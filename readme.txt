This is the VBA library contains many useful SUBs/FUNs. 
All the VBA subroutines are stored as Sub_NameXx.txt
All the VBA functions   are stored as Fun_NameXx.txt
All the complete Excel apps with VBA are stored as APP_NameXx.xlsm

Now I start the idea to save all my favourite subs, I am sure it will be beneficial for the long run.
